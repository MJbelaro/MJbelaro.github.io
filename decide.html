      <h2>Determine the Goals</h2>
      <p>The primary goal of this evaluation is to assess the usability of the Employee Management System (EMS) through heuristic evaluation. We aim to identify areas of improvement in terms of user interaction, task efficiency, and visual clarity while using the system for managing departments, designations, and employees.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="decide-card spectrum-card">
      <h2>Explore the Questions</h2>
      <p>The evaluation is guided by the following key questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can users efficiently manage employee records without confusion?</li>
        <li>Are form validation and error messages helpful and user-friendly?</li>
        <li>Does the system provide sufficient feedback when actions (like adding, editing, or deleting records) are performed?</li>
        <li>Are navigation and content structure consistent and easy to understand?</li>
        <li>Are there any violations of core usability heuristics such as consistency, visibility of system status, and error prevention?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="decide-card spectrum-card">
      <h2>Choose the Evaluation Approach and Methods</h2>
      <p>This project uses a heuristic evaluation method based on Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. Evaluators independently reviewed the interface and documented usability issues, which were then compiled and categorized by severity. No end-user testing was performed; rather, expert evaluators simulated common tasks.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="decide-card spectrum-card">
      <h2>Identify the Practical Issues</h2>
      <p>Evaluation was limited to the core modules available: Department Management, Designation Management, and Employee Records. Screenshots and interface behavior were manually reviewed. Limitations included time constraints and the absence of real user feedback. The evaluation was conducted on a local server using the included PHP and SQL files.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="decide-card spectrum-card">
      <h2>Decide How to Deal with Ethical Issues</h2>
      <p>This project did not involve real user data or human participants. All employee records used were sample or dummy data. Confidentiality and ethical compliance were ensured by anonymizing any potentially sensitive placeholders in the database or UI.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="decide-card spectrum-card">
      <h2>Evaluate, Interpret, and Present the Data</h2>
      <p>Issues were categorized by violated heuristic and severity. Each issue includes a screenshot (where applicable), a description, and a recommendation. These results are shared in the Evaluation Results page and are intended to guide further UI/UX improvements.</p>
